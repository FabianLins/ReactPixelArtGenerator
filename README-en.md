# Pixel Art Generator Result
## Used technologies/ frameworks
###### I make use of those technologies/ frameworks for my project:
	•	React with TypeScript
	•	SCSS with TailwindCSS

I made use of React because React is a modern JavaScript framework. JavaScript is a suited language for an interactive tool in the web browser. I chose the TypeScript variation because it is a decent solution to make the code more easily accessible for others. Each developer writes “his own” Vanilla JavaScript and TypeScript is a possibility to counteract against this problem. In addition you can recompile the code according to own preferences without rewriting it. I rate my React knowledges with 3/5, I have created several projects and got used to the official documentation. I have decent knowledge about JavaScript and rate my skills with 4/5.

I have made use of SCSS because SASS offers more possibilities than Vanilla CSS. You can make use of nesting, insert hex values instead of rgb values while using the rgba(…) function and it offers many more advantages. I have deep (S)CSS knowledge rate it with 5/5.
I used TailwindCSS as framework because it offers the possibility to write CSS freely without using Vanilla (S)CSS but still maintaining the advantages of a framework. This means you don’t have to care about a normalize.css file or something similar.

## Used 3rd Party Libraries
I make use of those 3rd party libraries:

| Name | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| TailwindCSS | Low Level CSS Framework|
| Html2canvas | Library to screenshot DOM elements|
| AutoPrefixer | Parses the CSS and adds vendor tags (installed due to TailwindCSS)|
| PostCSS | Compiles only the used CSS (installed due to TailwindCSS)|
| React | Modern JavaScript framework|
| Sass | CSS extension language|
| Typescript | JavaScript extension language|
| Vite | To initialize the React + TypeScript combination|

## Those components need to be installed locally:
	•	nodejs

## Installation / execution of the projects

You have to insert these commands in the command line / bash:

```console
$ git clone <linktorepository> lins-pixel-generator
$ cd lins-pixel-generator
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
